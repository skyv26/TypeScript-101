## Introduction to TypeScript

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, interfaces, and other advanced features to enhance the development experience. üöÄ Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, TypeScript brings robustness to your codebase and improves collaboration among team members.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the TypeScript goodness, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - Package manager for Node.js

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/typescript-repo.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. **Run the project:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Now, you're all set to explore the TypeScript wonders!

## Features of TypeScript

- **Static Typing:** Catch errors during development.
- **Interfaces:** Define clear contracts within your code.
- **Modern ECMAScript Features:** Leverage the latest JavaScript features.
- **Tooling Support:** Enjoy robust tooling for large codebases.
- **Gradual Adoption:** Add TypeScript incrementally to existing projects.

## Code Organization

Proper code organization is crucial for maintainability. Here's how this project is structured:

- **/src:** Contains the source code.

- **Unit Tests:** Cover individual functions and components.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify the collaboration of multiple parts.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Validate the entire application workflow.

Run tests using:
```bash
npm test
```
