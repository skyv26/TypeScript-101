# Lesson 1: Understanding what TypeScript is

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static types to your code, making it more robust and easier to maintain. TypeScript doesn't replace JavaScript but enhances it by providing tools for catching errors during development, improving code quality, and enhancing the development experience.

### Key Features:

1. **Static Typing:** TypeScript introduces static types that help catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime.
2. **Compatibility:** Existing JavaScript code is valid TypeScript, and you can gradually introduce types as needed.
3. **Tooling Support:** Enhanced tooling for better code completion, navigation, and refactoring in modern IDEs.
4. **Readability:** Type annotations serve as documentation, making it easier to understand the structure of your code.
5. **ECMAScript Compatibility:** TypeScript supports the latest ECMAScript features and can compile down to older versions.

## Why TypeScript?

### 1. Static Typing

Static typing means declaring the data type of a variable at compile-time. This catches potential errors early in the development process.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Without TypeScript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// With TypeScript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a + b;
}
```

In the TypeScript version, we explicitly define the types of `a` and `b`, making the function more predictable and less error-prone.

### 2. Improved Readability

Type annotations make code more self-documenting, reducing the need to dig into the implementation details to understand the code.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Without TypeScript
function greet(person) {
    return `Hello, ${person}!`;
}

// With TypeScript
function greet(person: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${person}!`;
}
```

The TypeScript version clearly states that the `person` parameter should be a string, improving code readability.

### 3. Tooling Support

Modern IDEs provide advanced tooling for TypeScript, offering features like autocompletion, refactoring suggestions, and inline documentation.

### 4. Easier Collaboration

TypeScript encourages the use of interfaces, making it easier to define contracts and collaborate with other developers.

### 5. Gradual Adoption

You can introduce TypeScript gradually into existing projects, allowing you to benefit from static typing where needed.

## Getting Started

Let's dive into the practical side. To start using TypeScript, you need to install it and set up a basic project.

### Installation

1. **Install Node.js and npm:**
   - Visit [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version.
   - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install TypeScript globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g typescript
   ```

### Setting up a basic TypeScript project

1. **Create a new project folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-ts-project
   cd my-ts-project
   ```

2. **Initialize your project:**
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

3. **Create a simple TypeScript file:**
   ```typescript
   // greeter.ts
   function greet(person: string): string {
       return `Hello, ${person}!`;
   }

   const user = "John Doe";
   console.log(greet(user));
   ```

4. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:**
   ```bash
   tsc greeter.ts
   ```

   This will generate a `greeter.js` file.

5. **Run your JavaScript code:**
   ```bash
   node greeter.js
   ```

And there you have it! You've just written and executed your first TypeScript code.
